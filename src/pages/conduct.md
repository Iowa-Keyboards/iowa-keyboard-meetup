# Code of Conduct

The Iowa Keyboard Meetup is committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for all keyboard enthusiasts. This event is a celebration of community, creativity, and shared interests, and we believe everyone should feel comfortable participating -- regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, keyboard layout, switch preference, or keycap style.

## We ask all attendees to:

- Be respectful, kind, and considerate to everyone.
- Avoid any form of discriminatory, demeaning, or harassing behavior or speech.
- Watch out for one another. If you see something concerning, let an organizer know.
- Only handle other people's keyboards or items with permission and care.
- Keep an eye on your personal belongings.
- Understand that any buying, selling, or trading is done at your own risk â€” organizers are not liable for these transactions.
- Engage sincerely and positively to help make the event enjoyable for all.

## Unacceptable behavior includes but is not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or abuse of any kind.
- Use of sexual imagery, unwelcome sexual attention, or inappropriate physical contact.
- Disruption of the event or its activities.
- Threats or violent behavior of any kind.

If you are asked to stop any unacceptable behavior, you are expected to comply immediately. Organizers reserve the right to remove any participant from the event without warning or refund, and may ban individuals from future meetups if necessary.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please speak to an organizer right away. Your concerns will be taken seriously and handled discreetly.
