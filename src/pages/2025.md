## Iowa Keyboard Meetup 2025

May 3rd, 2025

[Reddit Post]()

Our fourth keyboard meetup! Back at confluence with another great keyboard meetup. Thank you to those that came out and brought their keyboards.  

This year we had special corn macropads made for each guest. [The assembly guide can be found here.](https://docs.pikatea.com/AssemblyGuides/iowa-2025-macropad.html)
