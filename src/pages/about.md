## About the Iowa Keyboard Meetup

The Iowa Keyboard Meetup began in 2022 during a time when the mechanical keyboard hobby was seeing unprecedented growth. What started as a simple idea, bringing local enthusiasts together, quickly became something much bigger. Organized by Jack, owner of Pikatea Keyboard Company, the very first meetup was held in his garage after an interest check on r/MechanicalKeyboards and within the Pikatea Discord. Even then, people traveled from as far as North Dakota to attend, setting the tone for what would become an annual tradition.



The meetup grew rapidly. In 2023, nearly 40 attendees gathered at Fox Brewing in Valley Junction, showcasing everything from artisan keycaps and ergonomic boards to wild 3D-printed creations (and even a Gater Ron). When Fox Brewing later closed, a new home was found at Confluence Brewing in Des Moines, now the venue for several meetups and counting. By 2024, attendance had grown to 60+ people, and that year also marked the first Iowa mini-meet in downtown Des Moines. The 2025 meetup expanded even further with the addition of an official after party.

With the 2026 meetup returning to Confluence Brewing, the Iowa Keyboard Meetup continues to grow year after year. While the keyboards are always impressive and fun to see, the true highlight has always been the people, reconnecting with old friends, meeting new ones, and sharing passionate debates over layouts, switches, and keysets. Keyboards may change, but the relationships built here last.

We extend a huge thank you to our sponsors, volunteers, and everyone who has helped make these events possible, and especially to all the attendees who take time out of their lives to join us each year. Your enthusiasm and support are what make the Iowa Keyboard Meetup special. We cannot wait to see what the future holds, and we look forward to welcoming you to the next meetup.
